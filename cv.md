## About me:
I am a passionate and result-oriented .NET backend developer with a small but confident working experience. I can proudly say that I have contributed to the implementation of high-quality and reliable solutions for the client.
My driving force is the desire for continuous development, so I am actively studying frontend technologies and tools to become a successful Full Stack developer. I believe that my experience working with backend and a general understanding of the development process will help me quickly master frontend and achieve the desired results.
In my work, I value teamwork, openness, and willingness to share knowledge. Thanks to my communication skills, I can easily establish interaction with colleagues, managers, and stakeholders.
In my free time, I actively explore new technologies and tools in the field of development. In this way, I strive to be a versatile specialist and be prepared for the constantly changing world of IT.
